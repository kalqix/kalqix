**The First vApp.**  
A new category of trading venue: speed of a CEX, security of a DEX—no compromises.

## What is KalqiX?

[KalqiX](https://kalqix.com) is a **verifiable order-book DEX** for spot and perpetuals. It delivers **<10ms latency**, **250K+ TPS**, and **ZK-sealed trades**—so you don’t have to pick between speed and self-custody.

Every deposit, fill, and withdrawal is **proven** by zero-knowledge proofs, offering **provable, private execution**. KalqiX combines **real-world performance** with **on-chain verifiability**.

We call it a **vApp (verifiable app)**. Others just call it the future.

## Core Problem

Traders today face a grim trade-off:

- **Centralized exchanges (CEXs)** offer speed, but you give up custody and trust.
- **Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)** offer control, but you sacrifice performance.

Why settle for less when you can have both?

  HFT-grade performance with deterministic finality.
